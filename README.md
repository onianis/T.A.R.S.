# T.A.R.S.

## Overview
**T.A.R.S.**, otherwise known as the **Tutelary Assessment-Review System** is a highly efficient, precise, and effective vulnerability scanner. It can execute lightweight, parallelized, and non-intrusive checks on a range of IPs, on various ranges of ports.

In the backend, **T.A.R.S.** utilizes **O.P.E.N.**, or the **Omnipotent Port Emergence Norm** to scan ports of target systems â€” gathering information about specific services, versions thereof, and other information made available for harvest by the target system.

After completing a scan, **T.A.R.S.** produces a stylized, easy-to-navigate report that provides detailed information on every single possible vulnerability that might be affecting the target systems. 

The findings are cross-referenced with the *MITRE CVE* for the definition, and then with the *NIST NVD* for more detailed information. Wherever possible, **T.A.R.S.** also provides information on any *APTs* that might be linked with any given vulnerability as well as specific *TTPs* that a given exploit might serve the purpose of.
